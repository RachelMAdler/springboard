    "## 1. Problem definition\n",
    "Individuals often post sarcastic or ironic messages on social media sites, and businesses (and sometimes governments) need to be able to distinguish between what is intended literally and what is not.  The model generated for this project would enable organizations to perform this classification."

    "Businesses and government organizations that use Twitter data will benefit from this project.  The model generated by this project would enable such organizations to identify unlabeled sarcastic tweets and distinguish them from literal tweets.  This model could also aid in sentiment analysis, to determine when an utterance's sentiment should be negated or examined more closely."

    "The tweets for this project were gathered between July and October of 2017 via the Twitter REST API.  The most recent 3,200 tweets made by the 3,573,510 followers of John Oliver were acquired (over 2 billion total tweets).  Tweets that were retweets were excluded.  Of the total acquired tweets, 30,910 contain the sarcasm hashtag, which will be used as the true label.  The negative examples consist of hashtags with the \"happy\" hashtag (12,639 tweets), \"sad\" hashtag (40,861 tweets), and the \"seriously\" hashtag (11,450 tweets). In addition, profile information was gathered for each user, including number of friends, number of followers, date account was created, and location."

    "2. I removed tweets that only contained a URL\n",
    "3. I removed tweets the contained more than one hashtag, to make the comparison between sarcastic and non-sarcastic tweets clearer\n",
    "4. I removed tweets where the hashtags of interest (#sarcasm, #happy, #sad, and #seriously) were *not* at the end of the tweet text\n",
    "5. I removed the hashtag itself from the tweet text\n",
