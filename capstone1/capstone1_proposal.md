# Capstone Project 1: Proposal

## Problem
Businesses often promote habits to increase individuals’ personal cyber-safety.  In order for these campaigns to be effective, it is important to demonstrate a clear link between good cybersecurity habits and actual increased cyber-safety.  In addition, it is possible that certain groups of individuals are at increased risk for cyber-security incidents.  If so, education efforts should target these particular groups.  Thus, this project will show (a) whether engaging in better cybersecurity practices adequately protects individuals from online attacks, and (b) whether certain groups of individuals are more vulnerable to such attacks.

## Client
There are two groups of clients that may profit from this project.  The first group of clients comprises organizations that promote cybersecurity, such as the U.S. Department of Homeland Security or the National Integrated Cyber Education Research Center.  These groups seek to educate Americans about good cybersecurity habits.  The second group of clients is businesses that strive to increase their customers’ cybersecurity efforts to improve their company’s overall security.  For both types of clients, this project will provide evidence to be shared with consumers that may help encourage better habits.  In addition, this project will highlight particular groups of individuals that these organizations should focus their efforts on.

## Data
The data for this project come from a Pew Research Center survey conducted in June 2016.  The survey respondents consisted of 1,040 adult internet users in the U.S.  All data are publically available via the Pew Research Center (http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/01/26/americans-and-cybersecurity/).  The complete dataset contains 1040 rows (observations) and 121 columns (variables).  Of these 121 columns/variables, seven are related to security incidents an individual has experienced; all data are categorical (1 = yes, 2 = no).  Twenty variables are related to individuals’ cyber-security habits.  All of these data are categorical; some are binary (1 = yes, 2 = no) and some have more than two responses (e.g., type of security feature used to access phone: pin, password, thumbprint, other).  Finally, there are sixteen variables containing demographic information.  Some of these data are continuous (e.g., age), some are ordinal (e.g., highest level of education), and some are categorical (e.g., race).
 
## Approach
Broadly speaking, the goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of individuals’ cyber-security incidents based on (a) their cybersecurity habits and (b) demographic characteristics, such as age, race, political party, and income.  First, the survey questions and corresponding data for each component will be identified.  Missing values will be omitted from all analyses.  Next, I will perform exploratory data analyses to summarize the overall patterns in the data.  In addition, I will construct visualizations of these data to highlight these patterns.  Finally, I will construct a model to predict individuals’ likelihood of experiencing a cybersecurity incident (the outcome variable).  Variables representing individuals’ cybersecurity habits and demographics characteristics will be entered in the model as inputs.  Different models will be compared to identify the best way of representing the data and predicting the outcome variables of interest.  Dimension reduction is likely to be required due to the large number of possible fields/features in the data, relative to the number of examples/samples.

## Deliverables
The deliverables of this project will include the code for all analyses as well as a brief report of the results and a slide deck summarizing the findings.
